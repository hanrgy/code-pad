# Development Plan: Real-Time Multiplayer Code Pad

## üéØ Project Goal
Build a collaborative code editor with real-time synchronization and AI-powered assistance in 60 minutes.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Budget: 60 Minutes Total

### Phase 1: MVP Development (60 minutes)

#### 1. Basic Editor Setup (15 minutes) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Get Next.js running with Monaco Editor
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
- [x] Install dependencies (Monaco Editor, Socket.IO client, OpenAI)
- [x] Create basic page layout with Monaco Editor
- [x] Test syntax highlighting works
- [x] Verify editor can load and display code

**Key Files to Create:**
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `app/page.js` - Landing page
- `app/room/[id]/page.js` - Room editor page
- `components/CodeEditor.js` - Monaco wrapper

**Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install @monaco-editor/react socket.io-client openai
npm install -D tailwindcss
```

---

#### 2. Real-time Synchronization (20 minutes) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Multiple browsers can edit the same document simultaneously
- [x] Set up Socket.IO server in Next.js API routes
- [x] Implement room-based connections
- [x] Add live cursor tracking
- [x] Handle text change broadcasting
- [x] Test with 2+ browser windows

**Key Components:**
- `app/api/socket/route.js` - Socket.IO server
- `lib/socket.js` - Client socket manager
- `components/UserList.js` - Show connected users
- Room joining/leaving logic

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Type in one browser ‚Üí appears in other browser
- [ ] Cursor movements are visible across browsers
- [ ] Multiple users can edit simultaneously

---

#### 3. AI Integration (15 minutes) ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
**Goal**: AI can analyze code and provide suggestions
- [ ] Create OpenAI API route
- [ ] Add AI action buttons (Fix, Refactor, Explain)
- [ ] Implement code selection ‚Üí AI analysis flow
- [ ] Display AI suggestions in UI
- [ ] Test with sample buggy code

**Key Components:**
- `app/api/ai-assist/route.js` - OpenAI integration
- `components/AIPanel.js` - AI suggestions UI
- `lib/openai.js` - OpenAI client setup

**AI Actions to Implement:**
- [ ] **Fix**: Debug and fix code issues
- [ ] **Refactor**: Improve code structure
- [ ] **Explain**: Explain what code does
- [ ] **Test**: Generate unit tests

---

#### 4. Polish & Demo Preparation (10 minutes) ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING
**Goal**: Make it demo-ready and visually appealing
- [ ] Add Tailwind CSS styling
- [ ] Create room code sharing UI
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Prepare demo script with sample code
- [ ] Test full workflow end-to-end

**Demo Script:**
1. Open two browser windows
2. Create room, copy room code
3. Join room in second window
4. Type buggy function
5. Use AI to fix the code
6. Show real-time collaboration

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Socket.IO Setup**: Have fallback demo if WebSocket issues
- **OpenAI API Latency**: Prepare backup responses
- **Monaco Editor**: Simple textarea fallback if needed

### Demo Risks
- **Network Issues**: Local demo preparation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on Chrome/Safari/Firefox
- **Performance**: Test with larger code samples

---

## üìä Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Demo
- [ ] Two browsers can edit same document
- [ ] Real-time cursor tracking works
- [ ] AI can suggest code fixes
- [ ] Demo runs smoothly for 5 minutes

### Stretch Goals (if time permits)
- [ ] Multiple programming language support
- [ ] Better conflict resolution
- [ ] User avatars/names
- [ ] Code execution (if very fast to implement)

## üìù Notes & Learnings

*Track insights, blockers, and solutions here as we build...*

### Decisions Made
- Using Next.js API routes instead of separate Python server
- Monaco Editor for VS Code-like experience
- Socket.IO for reliable WebSocket handling
- OpenAI JavaScript SDK for AI integration

### Blockers & Solutions
*Will track any issues encountered and how we resolved them*

---

*This plan will be updated in real-time as we make progress through the buildathon.*
